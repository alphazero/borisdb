##about

Frankinstore is a basic persistent, content addressable, blob store, backed by bolted DB. Binary blobs can be of arbitrary non-zero size. Keys are the 20 byte computed SHA-1 signature of the blob. 

Frankinstore exposes 2 web endpoints for the supported `Get` and `Put`

## instalation

Clone the project and run the top-level server.go. 

    git clone https://github.com/alphazero/frankinstore.git
    cd frankinstore
    
    # run using -h to get options details
    go run server.go [options]
    

## API


###Put

Put is a POST method call to the service. If successful (http-stat 200), the response body is the associated key of the blob. Note that the key is returned as binary (e.g. 20 bytes) and is not encoded.
 
     method:    POST
     uri:       /put
     body:      <binary blob>
  
example (assuming localhost:5722):

     http://localhost:5722/put

###Get

Get is a simple GET method call to the service. If successful (http-stat 200), the response body is the value binary blob.
 
     method:    GET
     uri:       /get/<hex-encoded-key>
  
example (assuming localhost:5722):

     http://localhost:5722/get/316eb0ec4c0f75f4cbb19b6b5e59142e0fb01214
     
## server options
